Release History
===============

Unreleased (see `master <https://github.com/ofek/bit>`_)
--------------------------------------------------------

0.5.0 (2019-02-19)
------------------

- New :class:`~bit.MultiSig` adds support for P2SH nested m-of-n multisignature contracts
- Support for sending to P2SH and Bech32 output addresses
- P2SH nested segwit addresses for :class:`~bit.PrivateKey` and :class:`~bit.MultiSig`
- Support for batching transaction inputs from different keys

0.4.3 (2018-03-11)
------------------

- Fixed fee calculation when ``combine=False`
- **Breaking:** Exceptions will now be raised when using pay2sh addresses (until implemented)

0.4.2 (2017-12-09)
------------------

- Optimized network API priorities
- Fixed Smartbit pushtx usage
- Updated `21.co <https://www.21.co>`_ to `earn.com <https://www.earn.com>`_

0.4.1 (2017-11-01)
------------------

- Removed ``blockr.io`` network backend as `Coinbase <https://www.coinbase.com>`_ has shut it down.

0.4.0 (2017-04-19)
------------------

- Changed elliptic curve backend from OpenSSL to libsecp256k1. This results
  in an order of magnitude faster key creation and signing/verifying.
- Improved performance of base58 encoding/decoding.
- **Breaking:** Dropped support for Python 3.3 & 3.4.
- **Breaking:** :func:`~bit.verify_sig` now returns ``False`` for invalid
  signatures instead of raising an exception. Also, ``strict`` is no longer
  a parameter as BIP-62 compliance is now required.

0.3.1 (2017-03-21)
------------------

- **Fixed** :ref:`cold storage <coldstorage>` workflow.
- Improved performance of private key instantiation.

0.3.0 (2017-03-20)
------------------

- Implemented a way to use private keys in :ref:`cold storage <coldstorage>`.
- Changed the default timeout of services from 5 to 10 seconds.
- Fixed network service redundancy by failing if response code is not 200.

0.2.0 (2017-03-17)
------------------

- Improved stability of network tests.
- Added :func:`~bit.verify_sig`.
- Refactored crypto to yield over an order of magnitude faster hashing.

0.1.0 (2017-03-15)
------------------

- Initial release.
