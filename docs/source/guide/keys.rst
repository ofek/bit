Keys
====

Bit assumes the easiest way to reason about Bitcoin is in the basic unit of a
`private key`_ and, therefore, all functionality (viewing balance, making
transactions, etc.) is wrapped up in this class for convenience. You shouldn't
have to use anything else.

What is a private key?
----------------------

A private key is a derived point on an `elliptic curve`_. Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies use the `SEC`_ defined curve `secp256k1`_ due to its
properties that allow for particularly fast computation. The secret part
of a private key is essentially just a sequence of randomly generated bytes
(32 max); nothing special by itself. The features come when you derive a point
on the curve from that value.

**This value must be kept secret or you risk losing your funds permanently!**

Types
-----

Bit defines 2 kinds of private keys: :class:`~bit.PrivateKey`, aliased as
simply :class:`~bit.Key`, and :class:`~bit.PrivateKeyTestnet`. Both classes
have the exact same functionality.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bit import Key, PrivateKey, PrivateKeyTestnet
    >>>
    >>> Key == PrivateKey
    True
    >>>
    >>> dir(Key) == dir(PrivateKeyTestnet)
    True

The only difference is the network operations for :class:`~bit.PrivateKeyTestnet`
will use Bitcoin's test network where coins have no value. As such, the derived
address will also be different.

Further, there are 2 kinds of `multisignature`_ keys: :class:`~bit.MultiSig` and
:class:`~bit.MultiSigTestnet`. They incorporate a private key class from above
into a multisignature contract.

Creation
--------

Creation of a new private key is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bit import Key
    >>> key = Key()

To create a multisignature key a :class:`~bit.PrivateKey` (or
:class:`~bit.PrivateKeyTestnet`) must be provided in addition to a list or set
of public keys and the number of required signatures for the contract. The
public keys may be presented as strings in hex format or bytes.

The following code produces a multisignature contract requiring signatures from
both `key1` and `key2` to spend from:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bit import Key, MultiSig
    >>> key1 = Key()
    >>> key2 = Key()
    >>> multisig = MultiSig(key1, {key1.public_key, key2.public_key}, 2)

**IMPORTANT:**

When providing as argument public keys with a set such as above, then Bit will
sort the public keys internally in lexicographical order similar to how
`Electrum`_ behaves.
If the public keys are provided with a list, then the ordering of the public
keys of that list are used, similar to how Bitcoin Core behaves.
Calling :func:`~bit.MultiSig.public_keys` will always return a list with the
public keys in the order they are being used by in the multisignature contract.

Public Point
------------

Each unique value applied to the curve will yield a unique point. As this
is a one-way function, there is no known way to derive the private value
from the point.

You can see it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key.public_point
    Point(x=97142194878787224003202190607135598251247304976930950188466413219499502457410, y=43606604972619611673144670688496329906728122067438546662512577612023859619611)

You will never use this directly.

Public Key
----------

A public key is a public point serialized to bytes. By default all keys will
use the compressed version unless :ref:`you explicitly need otherwise <bytestowif>`.
This reduces the size of each transaction and thus fees.

Access it like so:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key.public_key
    b'\x03\xd6\xc4\x88\xab[S\x1d_\xb1H\x12\xbe\x19C\x08\x16\x90~@\x9fv-\x95\xf0w\x87\xfdB\x81\xa3\xd2B'

You will also never use this directly. This value is only used internally to
derive your address and is needed in the construction of every transaction.

Addresses
---------

All keys possess a :attr:`~bit.PrivateKey.address` property which is derived from your public key:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key.address
    '1KF3Vas28f5tnt3rj2fWyR89V9MPw51xhX'

This is what you share with others to receive payments.

Bit also allows to use nested Segwit addresses, which can be displayed with the
:attr:`~bit.PrivateKey.segwit_address` property:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key.segwit_address
    '3DYf8JL9F6Lmz98gpvYMH5qVMXAEazSEEn'

The address of a multisignature key can be displayed in similar manner using the
same properties :attr:`~bit.MultiSig.address` and :attr:`~bit.MultiSig.segwit_address`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> multisig.address
    '328k6RPdgRTLJZe9JUZUanNnJPtWB8tkvM'
    >>> multisig.segwit_address
    '3AkJkY9XESnPPuX2ZMFotyGggbytxfNRVZ'

Formats
-------

WIF
^^^

The `wallet import format`_ is the primary way of representing private keys. This
format stores the secret value as well as some metadata such as whether or not the
public key should be compressed.

To import a private key you can pass a key in wallet import format directly to
the initializer:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key = Key('L3jsepcttyuJK3HKezD4qqRKGtwc8d2d1Nw6vsoPDX9cMcUxqqMv')
    >>> key.address
    '1ExJJsNLQDNVVM1s1sdyt1o5P3GC5r32UG'

Export:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key = Key()
    >>> key.to_wif()
    'KxVhypbvS3hEYPAP3pYuH1LtcfbdEUcugiqg7fNFUUnmEfWVXJV4'

If you don't know what kind of private key your WIF represents, and you don't
want to force the use of a particular class, you can do this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bit import wif_to_key
    >>>
    >>> key = wif_to_key('cU6s7jckL3bZUUkb3Q2CD9vNu8F1o58K5R5a3JFtidoccMbhEGKZ')
    >>> print(key)
    <PrivateKeyTestnet: muUFbvTKDEokGTVUjScMhw1QF2rtv5hxCz>

Hex
^^^

Import:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key = Key.from_hex('c28a9f80738f770d527803a566cf6fc3edf6cea586c4fc4a5223a5ad797e1ac3')
    >>> key.address
    '1ExJJsNLQDNVVM1s1sdyt1o5P3GC5r32UG'

Export:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> key = Key()
    >>> key.to_hex()
